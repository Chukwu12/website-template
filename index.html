          <p>ABC’s of Mental Health highlights the importance of mental health conversations in our current social climate. We start by centering on the letters and words foundational to our language, word choice, and the context in which we speak about mental health. Digging deep into understanding the power of words, we use this basic concept as a lens to reframe how we see, understand, and ultimately communicate regarding
             mental health to promote anxiety-free, emotionally safe spaces.

          <p>Mental Health in Color centers on unique experiences related to mental health
             for BIPOC populations. In this training, we focus on how people of color must
              distinctly navigate mental health and wellness issues, access to healthcare,
               and how social and professional paradigms affect their lives. We emphasize how equity and anti-oppressive perspectives directly promote emotionally safe and anxiety-free spaces for people of color in the United States.

        <p>I created this space with you in mind. What you’re experiencing is real. It’s not in your head. More than 1 in 5 people live with a mental illness, and rates have become even more prevalent in BIPOC populations.
          Among the most common mental health conditions are anxiety disorders, for which nearly 40% of people receive no professional treatment. These conditions are amplified by structures and by-products of systemic oppression that marginalize people, severely impacting their quality of life and often leading to debilitating effects. 
          There is a need for safe spaces practicing healing-centered approaches that authentically address mental health issues in bold and personable ways. Here, we embody the radical idea that wellness is the foundation and conduit through which you can live your desired life. 
          
          In this space, we redefine wellness. 
          In this space, we hear you. 
          In this space, we see you.
          </p>
          <p>I strategically consult and coach organizations and individuals on creating, promoting, and sustaining wellness and positive mental health practices with specific expertise in general anxiety disorder. As a result, my clients learn to implement realistic wellness practices that positively support, elevate, and empower their well-being leading to increased confidence for individuals and sustainability and profitability for businesses.

      <p>I am a bold believer. I am an anxiety annihilator. I am a rich auntie. I am a beautiful Black woman. A dedicated daughter. A justice seeker. A truth-teller. A sometimes know-it-all. I am Destiny McCoy. I share my own story about my struggles with anxiety with no shame, knowing that it will help someone else see hope in their own journey. 
        For the last 13 years, I have been a mental health leader dedicated to creating safe spaces for justice-involved individuals, youth, and urban communities. Most recently, I have intentionally curated healing-centered spaces for individuals struggling with anxiety, especially women who typically report anxiety at higher rates. I believe the
         only way to challenge and overcome anxiety is through resistance, vulnerability, and truth. When someone walks away from me, they will feel more knowledgeable and know the truth because I’m not watering anything down. I care about people, and that is my superpower.

        <li class="lead"><i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i> A few years ago, I passed out while I was driving. At the height of the pandemic, I worked a full-time and part-time job while trying to start a business. I remember feeling this intense pressure to excel at a time when there was so much uncertainty as we were all trying to navigate living in a pandemic. No one was saying it was okay to slow down. I didn't hear anyone say it was okay just to be. My body shut down.

        <li class="lead"><i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i> 
          In 2022, right back under the pressure of doing everything on my own, I experienced anxiety like never before. I couldn't drive. I couldn't stay alone. I had insomnia along with racing thoughts. This time, I leaned into my faith like never before and experienced God like never before. I found God. I found myself. I vowed to never give up on myself, and I didn't. It was honestly the hardest thing I've ever gone through.

        <li class="lead"><i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i>
