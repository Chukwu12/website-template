        <h1>Culture of Wellness</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Culture of Wellness, where wellness is redefined. In this space, we educate people on wellness as a concept, emphasizing wellness as a core value instead of an intervention or reaction to trauma. We work with you to help wellness become a habit that is incorporated. We embody the radical idea that wellness is the foundation and conduit through which you can live the life you desire
        I strategically consult, coach, and advise businesses, corporations, organizations, and individuals on how to create, promote, and sustain wellness and positive mental health practices. As a result, my clients learn to implement positive wellness practices that support, elevate, and empower their well-being leading to increased sustainability and profitability.</p>

      <p>Authentic, bold, candid, personable, and always transparent, Destiny is dedicated to creating spaces for millennial black women through resistance, 
        vulnerability, and truth. In 2019, she became the Community Impact Leader for My Brother’s Keeper, an initiative launched by President Obama and supported 
        by the Obama Foundation. Under her leadership, she supported the collective impact efforts of the local My MBK program and other MBK programs across the United States
         to drive program delivery and sustainability. Destiny was the only African-American female to lead a national impact city for My Brother’s Keeper. Additionally, Destiny 
         has over twelve years of experience in the field of mental health. Destiny’s experience, commitment to mental health, social justice, and love for the culture led to her
          founding Culture of Wellness, a mental health and wellness lifestyle brand dedicated to elevating the voices of women of color.
