          <li class="lead"><i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i> A few years ago, I passed out while I was driving. At the height of the pandemic, I worked a full-time and part-time job while trying to start a business. I remember feeling this intense pressure to excel at a time when there was so much uncertainty as we were all trying to navigate living in a pandemic. No one was saying it was okay to slow down. I didn't hear anyone say it was okay just to be. My body shut down.
            .</li>
          <li class="lead"><i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i> After that scare, I decided to prioritize my wellness. With my village's support, I was able to bounce back and even have a Real Hot Girl Summer. Ha! But how many people know old habits don't die fast? 
          </li>
          <li class="lead"><i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i> 
            In 2022, right back under the pressure of doing everything on my own, I experienced anxiety like never before. I couldn't drive. I couldn't stay alone. I had insomnia along with racing thoughts. This time, I leaned into my faith like never before and experienced God like never before. I found God. I found myself. I vowed to never give up on myself, and I didn't. It was honestly the hardest thing I've ever gone through. 
          </li>
          <li class="lead"><i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i> 
            I share my story because many people, especially women who look like me, struggle with anxiety in silence and shame. I am not ashamed, and you are not alone. I am thriving through anxiety, and so can you. </li>

          <p>I created this space with you in mind. What you’re experiencing is real. It’s not in your head. More than 1 in 5 people live with a mental illness, and rates have become even more prevalent in BIPOC populations.
            Among the most common mental health conditions are anxiety disorders, for which nearly 40% of people receive no professional treatment. These conditions are amplified by structures and by-products of systemic oppression that marginalize people, severely impacting their quality of life and often leading to debilitating effects. 
            There is a need for safe spaces practicing healing-centered approaches that authentically address mental health issues in bold and personable ways. Here, we embody the radical idea that wellness is the foundation and conduit through which you can live your desired life. 
            
            In this space, we redefine wellness. 
            In this space, we hear you. 
            In this space, we see you.
