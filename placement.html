                    ABC’s of Mental Health highlights the importance of mental health conversations in our current social climate. We start by centering on the letters and words foundational to our language, word choice, and the context in which we speak about mental health. Digging deep into understanding the power of words, we use this basic concept as a lens to reframe how we see, understand, and ultimately communicate regarding mental health to promote anxiety-free, emotionally safe spaces.

                    Mental Health in Color centers on unique experiences related to mental health for BIPOC populations. In this training, we focus on how people of color must distinctly navigate mental health and wellness issues, access to healthcare, and how social and professional paradigms affect their lives. We emphasize how equity and anti-oppressive perspectives directly promote emotionally safe and anxiety-free spaces for people of color in the United States.

                    In the Parent Just Don’t Understand training, we give voice to how young people experience mental health and what wellness means at different developmental stages of life. In addition, we also give attention to coping skills, interpersonal skills, and problem-solving. In this training, emotion regulation is a core component to promote emotionally safe spaces for youth to express creative freedom.
