                    ABC’s of Mental Health highlights the importance of mental health conversations in our current social climate. We start by centering on the letters and words foundational to our language, word choice, and the context in which we speak about mental health. Digging deep into understanding the power of words, we use this basic concept as a lens to reframe how we see, understand, and ultimately communicate regarding mental health to promote anxiety-free, emotionally safe spaces.

                    Mental Health in Color centers on unique experiences related to mental health for BIPOC populations. In this training, we focus on how people of color must distinctly navigate mental health and wellness issues, access to healthcare, and how social and professional paradigms affect their lives. We emphasize how equity and anti-oppressive perspectives directly promote emotionally safe and anxiety-free spaces for people of color in the United States.

                    In the Parent Just Don’t Understand training, we give voice to how young people experience mental health and what wellness means at different developmental stages of life. In addition, we also give attention to coping skills, interpersonal skills, and problem-solving. In this training, emotion regulation is a core component to promote emotionally safe spaces for youth to express creative freedom.

                  <li class="lead"><i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i> A few years ago, I passed out while I was driving. At the height of the pandemic, I worked a full-time and part-time job while trying to start a business. I remember feeling this intense pressure to excel at a time when there was so much uncertainty as we were all trying to navigate living in a pandemic. No one was saying it was okay to slow down. I didn't hear anyone say it was okay just to be. My body shut down.
                    .</li>
                  <li class="lead"><i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i> After that scare, I decided to prioritize my wellness. With my village's support, I was able to bounce back and even have a Real Hot Girl Summer. Ha! But how many people know old habits don't die fast?

                    In 2022, right back under the pressure of doing everything on my own, I experienced anxiety like never before. I couldn't drive. I couldn't stay alone. I had insomnia along with racing thoughts. This time, I leaned into my faith like never before and experienced God like never before. I found God. I found myself. I vowed to never give up on myself, and I didn't. It was honestly the hardest thing I've ever gone through.

                    I share my story because many people, especially women who look like me, struggle with anxiety in silence and shame. I am not ashamed, and you are not alone. I am thriving through anxiety, and so can you. </li>
